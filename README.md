This is a concept of a simple page in which cat-loving people unite to find the little furries a lair.
There are four types of "Angels" (how we call the cat-loving people):
1- Those who just found an abandoned cat but can't keep it - the Finders.
2- Those who can keep the little furry and provide for it, but not for long - the Hosts.
3- Those who can help with resources (money, food, medicine, etc) - the Providers.
4- Those who want to adopt for good - the Guardians.

The site - and its respective app, to be made - link each Angel so that all cats go from the cold and violent street to a warm and loving bed in the most seemingless way possible.
