# adoptmeow

 ## This page is my Capstone project for the Microverse's HTML and CSS course curriculum. The design was inspired on the work of [Mathew Njuguna](https://www.behance.net/mathewnjuguna) and others on Behance, specially this project: [patashuleke](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE). I have learned a lot and am very thankful!

### The original design is a Directory of Schools, but we are encouraged to change the theme to a different one, so I went ahead and created a site that helps people adopt cats. It would be a bridge between those who found cats abandoned, those who can keep them temporarily, those who can help with resources, and those who want to adopt them for good.
